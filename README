#Weather App
____________
This weather application gets the current weather as well as
the projected weather for the next 24hrs. 

This application utilises the openweathermap api to fetch
the data and is displayed using a simple stackc of 
html / css / js.

This was built quite some time ago, but recreated so that I 
could display it on my website as a small project. 

Future development ideas:
    - Pollen count
    - Responsive icons
